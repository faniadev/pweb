project 1

- In this project, I attempted to design my personal website with The "Instagram" theme, it didn't turn out as well as i expected though..
- As you can see, there are several pictures that are arranged into three rows on the home page as if you're going through someone's instagram profile. 
  (i used Table to arrange the pictures)
- I also included the amount of posts, followers, following, username and also a profile picture to complete the experience of using instagram.
- If you clicked one of the pictures, it'll link to another page that will show you my profile, interests, contact, etc.
- In the navigation bar you can see that each text turns into a darker color everytime you hover through it 
  and the little stars that you see, will also link to all my "posts" so you can get from any page on my website 
  to any other page since it is also the requirement of the project.
- The pictures on the home page fades whenever you hover through it too !
- In addition, i linked all my social media on the footer page.
- You can't really "like" the picture since I only edited and added the hearts and comments so it would feel like a real instagram post :-D
